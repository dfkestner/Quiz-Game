# Quiz Game
A timed, multiple choice quiz game where users receive points or lose time based on whether their answers are correct or incorrect. I tried a couple of different ways of displaying the question and answer sets, but ran into some snags creating an input field for the user's high score, and storing previously submitted high scores. There's still a lot more that needs to be done with this project, such as replacing the placeholder question sets with actual content, adding CSS, and debugging the JavaScript.

## Usage Instructions
Eventually users will be able to follow the link to the game and click the start button to begin the timer and start answering the questions. For each incorrect answer, ten seconds will be deducted from the timer, and for every correct answer, the user will receive 10 points. Once the timer is at zero or the questions have all been answered (whichever comes first), the user will be able to view and submit their final score and initials, and they will have the option to play the game again.
